## Attention
_**The development of DP will be stopped for good. There will be a final release within March 2017 mainly to iron out the last crash causing bugs. After that, only horrible bugs may be fixed at most. The development on the successor to DP, [Dimensional Pockets 2](https://github.com/NPException/Dimensional-Pockets-2), will be started after the aforementioned final release of DP.**_

## Current Release
