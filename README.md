## Attention
_**The development of DP has basically stopped. DP will likely only receive critical bugfixes if necessary. The development on the successor to DP is in the ideas phase.**_

If you want to have something similar to Dimensional Pockets for more recent Minecraft Versions, check out

- [Compact Machines](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/compact-machines) by Davenonymous, or
- [Dimensional Pockets II](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dimensional-pockets-ii) by TheRealZeher. As far as I can tell it was based on an older version of Dimensional Pockets (prior to version 0.10.0), but is heading in it's very own direction. While it's not an official successor to Dimensional Pockets, you should still give it a shot! :)
