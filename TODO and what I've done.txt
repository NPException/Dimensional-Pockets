TODO
========================
Exiting the cell.
	- Probably the hardest.
	- As you can see inside of TeleporterRegistry, I started making a system for it, and then got REALLY tired, so, all yours. :P
	- Needs to retain the position of the block that owns that cell, contained within chunkSet of TileDimensionalPocket.
	- So, you have the position of the block that is clicked to want to go out, if you have a system that registers the position of the tileEntities that HAVE that position, you can reverse engineer the coordSet to get out.
	- That's really it.
	- If you didn't understand that.
	- The chunkSet with TileDimensionalPocket contains the chunk data for the cell.
	- Now when you're in the cell, and right click a frame block, you pass the coordinates to the method onBlockActivated which I've put in BlockDimensionalPocketFrame already.
	- You can find the chunk coordinates from that.
	- And if you retain what tileEntity took what chunk coordinate set, then you should be able to spawn at the block.
	- Look at my helper class for tips on traversing the world.
	
Investigate the frame rate tank.
Textures for frame block.

Smoother gen for the dimension.

Book thingy, for information on how to use the mod.

What I've done.
========================
The dimension is done.
	- The only thing left is optimisations.
The main block is done.
	- You still need to do textures, Gel.
The frame is done.
	- Textures for it, and of course, a way out.
